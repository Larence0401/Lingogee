## Description

Lingogee is a browser-based chat application for one-to-one messaging. Lingogee allows you to get an instant in-app translation of you chat partner's messages into 8 languages. You can even get your own messages translated. You can toggle between showing the oiginal messages, showing the translation and showing original message and translation side-by-side.

## Why I built this app

This project helped me to get familiar with best practices and design patterns for chat applications in general. By building lingogee, I definitely got a lot of practice and deeper insights into modelling data in NoSQL databases. this project also enhanced my experience in working with RESTful APIs (Deepl API in this case)
